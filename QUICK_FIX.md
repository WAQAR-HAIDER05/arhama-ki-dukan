# ðŸš¨ Quick Fix - Create Your GitHub Repository

## The Issue:
Your repository `ecom-images` doesn't exist yet, which is causing the CORS errors.

## ðŸ”§ Quick Solution (2 minutes):

### **Step 1: Create the Repository**
1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new
2. **Owner:** WAQAR-HAIDER05 (should be selected)
3. **Repository name:** `ecom-images`
4. **Make sure it's PUBLIC** âœ…
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. **Click "Create repository"**

### **Step 2: Test Again**
1. **Refresh your browser** (http://localhost:5173/admin)
2. **Try uploading a product** with an image
3. **The system will automatically:**
   - Create the folder structure
   - Upload your first image
   - Create the products.json file

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: Test with Sample Data

If you want to test immediately without creating the repository, I can temporarily switch the system back to localStorage for testing, then switch to GitHub when you're ready.

**Which would you prefer?**
1. **Create the GitHub repository** (recommended - 2 minutes)
2. **Test with localStorage first** (quick test, then setup GitHub later)

Let me know which option you prefer!
